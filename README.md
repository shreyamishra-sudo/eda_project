# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

This repository contains exploratory data analysis work performed using Python.
The goal of these projects is to understand datasets through cleaning, transformation, visualization, and basic statistical insights.

The focus is on learning how real-world data behaves and how meaningful patterns can be extracted before applying advanced models.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## What This Project Covers
- Data cleaning and handling missing values
- Exploratory analysis using descriptive statistics
- Visual analysis using plots and charts
- Identifying trends, patterns, and outliers

## Project Structure
- Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks containing step-by-step analysis
- Datasets: CSV or other data files used for analysis
- Visualizations: Graphs and plots generated during analysis

## Status
This project is actively being developed.
More datasets and deeper analysis will be added as learning progresses.
